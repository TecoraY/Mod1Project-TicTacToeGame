# Mod1Project-TicTacToeGame
Tic Tac Toe game build for module 1 project using CSS HTML and JS
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game. 
I created this basic Tic Tac Toe game using buttons and the grid layout. 
There a two players one player chooses to be x and one player chooses to be o.
Typically X goes first, but either X or O may go first. 
As player O and X win they should populate their score at the bottom of the page using the score tracker.
Best of 5 wins.

The most challenging part was creating the different win combinations, but I worked it out and made it 
work in my own way. I hope you enjoy my first Javascript project. Improvements and more to come. Stay tuned!
